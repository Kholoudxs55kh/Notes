# **What is a User Story?**

A **user story** is a simple, clear statement about what a user wants to do with your project. It’s not just about a feature, but about the user's goal and why they need it. User stories help keep the focus on creating something useful for the user.

**Why Write User Stories?**

- **Understand the User:** Writing from the user’s perspective ensures your team stays focused on their needs.
- **Plan Better:** User stories help you estimate how long a task will take, which is useful for planning and communicating with stakeholders.
- **Build Empathy:** User stories help everyone—users, team members, and managers—understand each other’s needs and challenges.

**How to Write a User Story**

1. **Know Your Users:** Identify who your users are and what they want to do with your project.
2. **Use a Simple Formula:** 

   - **[Persona] wants to [do something] so that [reason]**

**Example of a User Story**

- **User:** A busy parent
- **Wants to:** Find quick, healthy recipes
- **So that:** They can save time and still eat well

This approach ensures that every feature is connected to a real need, making your project more effective and user-focused.
