# High-Level Design (HLD) Document

`An HLD document shows the overall plan of how a system will work. It uses diagrams and data flows to help developers understand the system's design.`


#### **Purpose of HLD:**

- Explains how different parts of the system connect and work together.
- Focuses on designing solutions based on business needs.
- Does not include technical details like network settings.

#### **Scope of HLD:**

- Shows the system’s structure, using simple terms rather than detailed technical language.
- Created by solution architects as a guide for detailed design (Low-Level Design "LLD").

#### **Key Points:**

- Considers functional needs, costs, and system performance.
- Ensures the system is scalable, consistent, and efficient.

## **Components of High-Level Design:**

- The HLD includes two key elements:
    1. **Attributes/Features:** Describes the features of the system's parts (like components and modules).
    2. **Relationships:** Shows how these parts are connected.

## **Purpose of High-Level Design:**

- The HLD gives a detailed overview of the system to show how different parts will work together.
- It serves as a guide for understanding how the system operates and how the modules interact.

## **Characteristics of High-Level Design:**

- Diagrams illustrate each part of the design.
- Includes descriptions of hardware, software, and user interfaces.
- Shows typical user workflows and performance expectations.
- Defines the overall architecture based on business needs.

## How to Design Scalable High-Level Design (HLD) Systems

`When designing a scalable system, it’s important to follow a clear roadmap to ensure all elements work together seamlessly. Below are key concepts and techniques to help design an effective, scalable high-level system.`

---

### 1. **Capacity Estimation**

    Capacity estimation involves predicting the resources (like processing power, memory, and bandwidth) needed to handle the expected workload. This step ensures the system can meet current and future demands without performance issues. 

**Example:**
Consider Twitter, where millions of tweets are shared every minute, especially by popular influencers. A well-designed system ensures these tweets reach a large audience without slowing down or crashing the platform.

---

### 2. **HTTP and HTTPS Methods**

    Understanding and using HTTP methods like GET, PUT, and POST efficiently is crucial when designing a system. These methods define how data is requested or sent between clients and servers.

**Tip for Interviews:**
Knowing when to use GET, PUT, or POST can help in explaining how API calls are structured in a scalable system.

---

### 3. **WebSockets**

    WebSockets allow real-time, two-way communication between the server and the client without waiting for a new request. They’re particularly useful in systems that require instant communication, like chat or gaming apps.

**Features:**

- **Full-Duplex Protocol:** Both the server and client can send/receive data at the same time.
- **Stateful Protocol:** The connection remains open until either the client or server closes it.
- **3-Way Handshake:** WebSockets use a TCP connection to establish secure communication between the server and client.

---

### 4. **Polling**

    Polling is a technique where the client repeatedly asks the server for updates. There are two types of polling:

- **Short Polling:** The server responds at fixed intervals, whether or not there's new data.
- **Long Polling:** The server waits until new data is available before responding, reducing the number of requests.

**Tip:**
Long polling is preferred as it minimizes unnecessary requests, which helps in optimizing performance.

---

### 5. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

    SSE is a one-way communication method where the server sends updates to the client. This is particularly useful for live updates, such as real-time streaming.

---

### 6. **Filtering**

    Filtering allows you to narrow down the data retrieved from an API or database by applying conditions, such as searching for a specific term. Sorting and pagination help organize and limit the data displayed to users.

**Example:**
If you're searching for bots or files with "fin" in the name, filtering will return results like "Finance," "Finder," and "DeltaFinance."

---

### 7. **Rate Limiting**

    Rate limiting controls how many requests can be sent within a specific timeframe. This prevents a system from being overwhelmed by too many requests at once. Once the limit is reached, the system blocks further requests.

**Example:**
If a system has a rate limit of 100 requests per minute, once that threshold is reached, any additional requests are blocked for the rest of the minute.

---

### 8. **Resiliency**

    Resiliency ensures that the system can handle failures (like hardware issues or memory shortages) without crashing. Techniques like replication (copying data to multiple servers), redundancy (having backup systems), and availability (ensuring systems stay online) help keep the system running smoothly.

**Example:**
In system design interviews, being able to explain how you would handle faults in your design using resiliency techniques is key to demonstrating your understanding of scalable systems.

---

### 9. **Paging**

    Paging divides large sets of data into smaller, manageable chunks for easier retrieval. For example, when a user browses through an online store, paging can ensure only a specific number of products are loaded at a time.

**Example:**
Apple may use paging to show only products available in a user’s geographical location, improving the speed and efficiency of the search process.

---

### 10. **Logging**

    Logging tracks system events (like transactions or service requests) to monitor the system’s behavior and health. It’s useful for debugging and ensuring the system performs as expected.

**Example:**
In a distributed system, centralized logging helps track issues across different microservices, improving fault detection and system maintenance.
