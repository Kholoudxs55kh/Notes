# System Design

## First Step: `Requirements Gathering`

- It's the process of brainstorming to figure out what a software or application needs to do.
  > Like a detailed list of what features and functions the system should have before building it.

## Steps with example

### `CASE`

    When Instagram was being developed, the team needed to figure out what features and functions to include in the app to attract users and keep them engaged.

#### 1. Find Out Who's Involved

    Discover who will use or be affected by the software by talking to them through interviews or surveys this can include end-users, clients, project managers, subject matter experts ...etc

Example:

Identify who will use Instagram and be affected by it **by** making interviews and surveys with potential users, such as social media enthusiasts, photographers, and everyday people => which led to them finding out their target people `casual users who like sharing photos and professional photographers who want to showcase their work.`

#### 2. Understand Their Needs

    Learn what each person or group needs from the software by organizing and prioritizing their feedback through open-ended questions and discussions, aim to uncover both explicit and implicit requirements.

**Example**:

Learn what each user group wants from the app **by** analyzing feedback and preferences from user interviews and surveys => which led them to know that `casual users wanted a simple way to share photos and connect with friends, while professional photographers wanted high-quality image sharing and tools for editing.`

#### 3. Define the Problem and Project Scope

    Describe clearly what problem the software will solve by discussing with people to understand the main issue and the scope of the project by outlining its objectives, boundaries, and limitations.

**Example**:

Describe what Instagram needs to address **by** discussing with users to pinpoint the core issues => which led to them to know that existing photo-sharing apps either too complex or lacking in features, and `Instagram aimed to provide a user-friendly experience with high-quality visuals.`

#### 4. Get the Details

    Record all the requirements in an easy-to-understand way by using interviews or brainstorming sessions about their needs, preferences, and expectations.

**Example**:

Collect specific details about what features the app should have **by** brainstorming sessions and user feedback to gather detailed requirements => which led to knowing that `users wanted features like photo filters, easy sharing to other social media platforms, and a simple interface for liking and commenting on posts`

#### 5. Write it Down

    Record all the requirements in an easy-to-understand way by creating documents that explain what the software needs to do such as user stories, use cases ...etc

**Example**:

Document all the requirements clearly and in an organized manner **by** documenting features such as photo filters, direct messaging, story sharing, and a feed for following other users.

#### 6. Check Everything

    Make sure the requirements are correct and complete by reviewing and verifing the details with everyone involved

**Example**:

Ensure the requirements are accurate and meet usersâ€™ needs **by** reviewing the requirements with potential users and made adjustments based on their feedback

## Why is Requirement Gathering important?

1. **Clear Objectives:**
   - Helps define and clarify what the software needs to achieve, ensuring everyone understands the project goals.

2. **Customer Satisfaction:**
   - Ensures the software meets customer needs, leading to a product that aligns with their expectations and desires.

3. **Scope Definition:**
   - Clearly outlines what the project will include, preventing unexpected changes and keeping the project on track.

4. **Avoid Misunderstandings:**
   - Reduces the risk of miscommunication by ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the requirements.

5. **Risk Management:**
   - Identifies potential issues early, minimizing costly errors and delays later in the project.

6. **Efficient Resource Use:**
   - Helps allocate resources accurately, avoiding waste and ensuring the project is completed efficiently.

## How Requirements Gathering helps in Agile Software Development

1. **User Stories:**
   - Requirements are captured as short, simple descriptions from the user's perspective, focusing on their goals and needs.

2. **Backlog Refinement:**
   - Regularly review and prioritize features in the backlog, ensuring the most important tasks are ready for development.

3. **Iterative Development:**
   - Work in cycles (sprints) to refine and adjust requirements as the project progresses, allowing flexibility and adaptation.

4. **Continuous Collaboration:**
   - Engage with stakeholders regularly to gather feedback, discuss changes, and refine requirements throughout the development process.

5. **Prototyping and Visual Aids:**
   - Use prototypes and visuals to clarify requirements, helping stakeholders visualize features and provide early feedback.

6. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Define clear conditions for each user story to ensure everyone agrees on what needs to be delivered, preventing misunderstandings.
